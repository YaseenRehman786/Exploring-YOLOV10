# Exploring-YOLOV10
I explored using YOLO for object detection. I trained my own dataset, taking over 70 photos of a blue dog and batman toy I had on hand and used data augmentation to triple the amount of data I had. I trained a small YOLOV10 model with that data set and implemented it in real time.
